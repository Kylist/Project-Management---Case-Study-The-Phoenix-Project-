1.	What is “CC Project”?
My project has the name of Communication Change project or “CC Project”. With the goal of solving communication problem among departments, which leads the inconsistence, delay and confusion all over Parts Unlimited, “CC Project” will provide step by step of how to change the way departments communicate. “CC Project” is a short but intense project that last for 4 weeks. This project focuses on developing new meeting and reporting systems.

2.	The communication problem.
In Parts Unlimited, the most urgent problem that the company must handle is the communication among departments. The miscommunication has resulted in confusion, delay and decreased quality of many projects. Some managers even underestimate meetings because they cannot see the result and find going to the meeting is a waste of time.
There are many problems that the company can observe as examples for the miscommunication among teams. They include the delay in Phoenix Project and the damage of the pay roll system, which is called “SAN project”. Moreover, the miscommunication also happens in every level of Parts Unlimited, especially in managers level. There is an example to show that even the CEO level of Parts Unlimited also suffers from the same problem. It is said in the article that the CEO of Parts Unlimited changes his mind of the priority to fix the pay roll when he heard about the collapsing of SAN, then he switched back the priority to Phoenix project in the meeting with the managers. This represents an inconsistent goal and purpose that all departments. The inconsistence in priorities, the underestimation of meeting among departments and the inefficient meetings play important parts in the corruption of the company.
Because the miscommunication is the root of every other current problem in Parts Unlimited, this problem should be considered as the priority problem to be solved.

3.	Justification.
The reason that makes miscommunication become the most pressing problem includes two main factors. They are the high frequent level and high impact level on quantity of the miscommunication. 
The highly frequent level of miscommunication can be seen in two smaller evidences. First, the miscommunication happens among managers level. The problem happens when the departments in the company don’t share the same goal for the company’s project. For example, when the sale department and IT department argue about the priority between the deadline of Phoenix project and reputation of the company due to the collapsing of SAN system. It is stated in the article that ““You tell me which is more important: getting our factory employees paid or getting the Phoenix tasks done?”. Second, the miscommunication between manager and team members can also be seen multiple time in Parts Unlimited. For example, it is stated when the whole team takes a lot of time to track back to the problem of the pay roll, which is known as the collapsing of SAN system. For the high-level impact of miscommunication, the company has suffered from the criticization from “union” after the delay in pay roll system and the complains from stakeholders after the delay of Phoenix project. The miscommunication has been dragging Parts Unlimited out of the race with its opponents because they spend too much time suffering from the results of their internal problem.
Therefore, the life and death of company depends on how Parts Unlimited make a change to its communication. With shortage of time and the increasing damage taken from miscommunication, the “CC Project” is the key for this problem. 

4.	Solution.
In order to solve this problem, Parts Unlimited must change their way of communication. The “CC Project” includes 2 new systems. They are the changes in the weekly meeting system among managers and the reporting system for every meeting.
First, the CEO and the managers should have a meeting to clarify the new methods of meeting, start doing training for managers and employees and hire a third party to develop a new reporting system. For the meeting system, I recommend that strict meeting should become flexible meeting, which allows managers can do online meeting or replacement meeting. Replacement meeting is a method of sending your team members to the meeting in urgent situation. It is said in the article “How to Solve Business Communication Problem” by Joseph DeBenedetti that “There are a number of ways you can communicate with your colleagues that go beyond face-to-face communication.” (DeBenedetti,2019, paragraph 4). For the reporting system, my recommendation is hiring specialists from a third party to develop and hold training section during “CC Project” for managers and some core team members. This tracking system will play an important part in making sure that all the managers are on the same page after every meeting. 
With new tracking and meeting system, all departments of Parts Unlimited will always be on the same page and have more motivation to participate in the weekly meeting. I recommend implementing the new meeting and reporting system that will address the communication among departments. This 1-month project will begin in April 28th and end in May 26th.  This project requires a budget of $629,904 and a team of 7 people, not including managers & team members who will participate in the training program or the CEO to be successful.
